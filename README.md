# A Simulation of Cribbage
The main goal of this is to determine what factors actually matter in high level cribbage play.
If there there are factors that matter, the secondary goal will be to find a strategy that has a statistically significant advantage
<br> The other thing was to just give a bit of practice writing in CPP as before this it has been about a year since i have worked with it

## Statistical Analysis
To be added uppon completeion. Probably will link a video
